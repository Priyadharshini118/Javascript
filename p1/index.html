We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
        And this is our place, we make the rules
        And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
        Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

        [Chorus]
        Can I go where you go?
        Can we always be this close?
        Forever and ever, ah
        Take me out and take me home
        You're my, my, my, my lover
